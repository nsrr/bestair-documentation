# About the Study

BestAIR is a planning study designed to provide information about design features that would strengthen a later, large-scale Phase 3 RCT. The study aimed to enroll approximately 225 patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea who had either established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at least 3 CVD risk factors into a two week run-in period, and then to randomize a projected 80% (n=180) of these individuals into a 12-month, 4-arm intervention study. For the run-in period, participants were asked to apply nasal dilator strips (Breathe RightÂ®) and a CPAP mask nightly (open to the atmosphere and not connected to a CPAP machine) and to complete a sleep diary. Two treatment arms included active CPAP and two were control conditions. All arms included nightly use of nasal dilator strips and conservative medical therapy (CMT) defined as formal provision of education on healthy sleep and healthy lifestyle.  The active groups were: 1) active CPAP treatment delivered using standard adherence education and support delivered by a trained sleep technician; 2) active CPAP treatment administered using adherence education and support delivered by a trained sleep technician and enhanced by a behavioral promotion intervention delivered by a sleep medicine behavioral therapist using cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement. The control groups were: 3) sham-CPAP use delivered by a trained sleep technician; and 4) CMT alone. The primary physiological outcome was change in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure from baseline to follow-up, based on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring data, in the two active compared to the two control groups. The primary process measures were recruitment yields, retention rates, and CPAP adherence levels, with specific interests in comparing adherence rates in the two active arms to assess any impact of a behavioral promotion intervention; and in comparing retention rates and patient-reported outcomes between the two control groups.
