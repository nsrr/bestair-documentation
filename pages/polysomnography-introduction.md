## Signal and annotation files

[Raw polysomnography data](:files_path:/) is available for 152 randomized participants at baseline and 93 at followup. Each recording has a signal file (.EDF) and event scoring (.XML).

1. **[EDF](:files_path:/polysomnography/edfs)** - Signal files in the [European Data Format](http://www.edfplus.info/) exported from Compumedics Profusion.
2. **[XML (NSRR)](:files_path:/polysomnography/annotations-events-nsrr)** - Annotation files processed in the [EDF Editor and Translator](https://www.sleepdata.org/tools/edf-editor-and-translator) tool.

NSRR XML files can be overlaid onto EDF signal files using the [EDF Viewer tool](https://sleepdata.org/community/tools/nsrr-edf-viewer). For more information about the XML translation (mapping) process, review the files available on the [EDF Editor and Translator Releases page](https://github.com/nsrr/edf-editor-translator/releases).
