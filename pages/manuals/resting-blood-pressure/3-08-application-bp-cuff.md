## 3.8 Application of the Blood Pressure Cuff

* 1. Place the appropriate cuff (as determined in the arm measurement procedure) around the bare non-dominant arm. (May have to use other arm if surgery or injury to non-dominant arm.)

 * The midpoint of the length of the bladder lies over the brachial artery and the mid-height of the cuff is at heart level.
 * The lower edge of the cuff, with its tubing connections, should be placed about 1 inch above the natural crease across the inner aspect of the elbow.

* 2. Wrap the cuff snugly about the arm, still with the palm of the participantâ€™s hand turned upward.
* 3. Firmly secure the wrapped cuff by applying pressure to the locking fabric fastener over the area where it is applied to the cuff.
