## 4.6 Measurements

Circumferences are measured in duplicate by a two person team.  If differences of >2% are observed, a third measurement is made.

### 4.6.1  Height

1. Position the participant in stocking feet so that their heels, buttocks, back, and head are touching the backboard of the stadiometer.
2. For some obese subjects, and subjects with scoliosis, this may not be possible. In these cases, the goal is to position the subject so that the spine is as erect as possible.
3. Position the participant’s head with the Frankfurt plane parallel to the floor – the top of the external auditory meatus (ear canal) should be level with the inferior margin of the bony orbit (cheek bone).
4. Ask the participant to take a deep breath in and look straight forward.
4. Lower the head piece of the stadiometer or the sliding part of the measuring rod to the crown of the head, so that the hair is pressed flat.
6. Measure height to the nearest centimeter.  f at a 0.4 cm, round to the nearest higher integer.
7. Record on the Physical Measurements Form.

### 4.6.2 Weight

1. Assure that the Healthometer digital scale or equivalent is set to record in kilograms.
2. Zero the scale before the participant is weighed.
3. Instruct the participant to stand on the center of the scale.  The participant should be in stocking feet with no blue jeans.
4. Measure weight to the nearest 0.1 kg.
4. Record on the Physical Measurements Form.

### 4.6.3 Hip Circumference

1. Instruct the participant to stand erect with arms at their sides and feet together.
2. For obese subjects, they should place their feet as close together as is comfortably possible.
3. Squat at the right side of the participant so that the level of the maximum extension of the buttocks can be seen.
4. Place an inelastic tape around the buttocks in a horizontal plane at this level without compressing the skin.
4. Have the assistant help position the tape on the opposite side of the participant’s body and assure that the tape is below the measurement value.
6. Make sure the tape is in contact with the skin but does not indent the soft tissue and that the zero end of the tape is below the measurement value.
7. Measure the hip circumference to the nearest 0.1 cm.
8. Take the measurement twice.
9. Record both measurements on the Physical Measurements Form.

### 4.6.4 Waist Circumference

This measurement should not be made over clothing.

1. Instruct the participant to stand erect with abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, and feet together.
2. Stand behind the participant and palpate the hip area for the right iliac crest.
3. Draw a line just above the crest using washable marker.
4. Make a second mark in the mid-axillary line.
4. Place a tape around the second mark.
6. Ask the participant to turn around slowly, while holding the tape in position so that the tape wraps around.
7. Make sure the tape is parallel to the floor, in line with the top of the hip crest, and does not compress the skin.
8. Measure the waist circumference at the end of a normal expiration to the nearest 0.1 cm.
9. Take the measurement twice.
10. Record both measurements on the Physical Measurements Form.

## 4.6.4 Neck Size

* 1. Instruct the participant to sit with head in the Frankfort horizontal plane.
* 2. Measure at the point below the thyroid prominence, keeping the non-stretchable tape perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the neck.

 * If the thyroid prominence cannot be located, ask the subject to swallow (or drink some water, if available) and feel for the “nob” that bobs up and down.
 * In women this may not be felt.  Use a point midway along the neck.

* 3. Measure the neck size to the nearest 0.1 cm.
* 4. Take the measurement twice.
* 4. Record both measurements on the Physical Measurements Form.
