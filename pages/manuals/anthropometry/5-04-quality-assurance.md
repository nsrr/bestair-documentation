## 5.4 Quality Assurance

There are many possible sources of error in making anthropometric measurements. These include use of non-calibrated equipment, improper positioning of the subject, incorrect or variable placement of recording devices, and transcription errors. To attempt the highest quality readings for BestAIR, the following approaches will be used:

* Central training and certification of staff
* Use of a 2-member team (a “measurer” and a “recorder”)
* Use of duplicate readings
* Use of  instrument calibration procedures
* Ongoing observation of technique
* Monitoring of between and within subject variability, digit preference, etc.

### 5.4.1 Certification Requirements

Observation of performing these measurements on 3 volunteers by a GCRC or 2 CCI trainers, with evidence that all elements of measurement are followed (placement of tapes, preparation of the participant)

* Evidence of agreement of 3 replicate readings within .5 cm or 0.1 kg (for weight) for each volunteer measured
* Evidence of agreement with the standard (i.e. Trainer) to within 0.5 cm or 0.1 kg (for weight), using the average of 3 readings per practice study subject.

### 5.4.2 Calibration of Equipment

* **Stadiometer**

 Every week, calibration should be performed and recorded in a calibration log book. It is performed by measuring the height of the standard metal bar.  If the standard bar does not measure its exact length, the supervisor in charge of equipment maintenance for the research equipment should be notified, who will contact Facilities Engineering or other appropriate parties to correct this.

* **Healthometer digital scale**

 The scale is calibrated once a week by using calibrated weights.

* **Tape measures**

 The length of the measuring tape is checked with the calibrated length rod (usually 150 cm) at least once per month. If the measuring tape is stretched or appears to have rippled edges it should be replaced.
