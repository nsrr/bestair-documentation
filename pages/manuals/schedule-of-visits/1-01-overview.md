## 1.1 Overview

Study visits and phone contacts should be completed within the designated timeframes.

If a visit or phone contact is completed outside these windows of time, it is considered a minor protocol deviation. BWH and BIDMC should follow their institutionâ€™s policy on reporting minor deviations and use the form provided by the IRB. Deviations will be entered into REDCap.

In some instances, study staff will be unable to complete the visits and contacts within the time windows. For example, deviations could result from patient noncompliance issues or a visit/phone contact might need to be changed owing to extenuating circumstances. All deviations must be documented. If you are attempting to schedule visits and contacts without success, please document the times, dates, and make notes about your attempts to attach to the deviation form. If a participant misses visits and staff has to reschedule, staff should document all efforts to contact the subject to keep within time windows.
