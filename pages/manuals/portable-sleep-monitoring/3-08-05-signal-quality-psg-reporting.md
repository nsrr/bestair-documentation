## 3.8.5 Signal Quality and PSG Reporting

Upon completed scoring an Embletta QS Form is filled out.  This form tracks the following:

1. Ppt ID number and acrostic
2. Study visit (0, 6 or 12 months)
3. Scorer ID number
4. Date recording received
5. Date of initial review
6. Unit (Embletta) ID number
7. Staff ID number (from recorder setup)
8. Study pass or fail with failure notes
9. Date study scored
10. AHI (reported as 3% AHI)
11. Analysis Start/Stop times
12. Total recording time
13. Hours of Usable Signal
14. Signal Quality Codes
15. Overall Study Quality
16. Urgent alert information

**<u>Hours of Usable Signal</u>** represents the number of hours between Lights OFF and Lights ON that a signal was reliable enough to use for scoring. This number is rounded down to the nearest whole number of hours.

**<u>Signal Quality Codes</u>** are then assigned to represent the percentage of the calculated Hours of Usable Signal that took place during sleep time. Each signal is reviewed for quality and assigned a quality grade that gauges the percentage of artifact free data during sleep.  Any questionable or absent signal is also noted in the QS form’s comment section. If a signal was of poor quality but is usable for scoring during sleep time, the signal’s Hours of Usable Signal and Signal Quality Code are both downgraded by one hour. If the signal was of poor quality during wake time, only the Hours of Usable Signal is downgraded by one.

**<u>Overall Study Quality</u>** is assigned to reflect the absolute duration of artifact free signals for the four primary signals: nasal pressure, oxygen saturation, and both respiratory effort belts:

 * **Fail:**  Less than 2 hrs of oximetry and nasal pressure or one band
 * **Poor:**  Oximetry and either nasal pressure or one band usable for > 2 hrs but less than 4 hrs
 * **Fair:**  Nasal pressure, one band, and oximetry or both bands and oximetry usable for > 4 hrs
 * **Excellent:**  All channels are useable for > 4 hrs but < 6 hrs
 * **Outstanding:**  All channels are good for > 6 hrs
