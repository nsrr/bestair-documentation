## 2.8.6 Urgent Alerts

Studies identified as potential urgent alerts are triaged for immediate scoring (within 2 business days). Once fully scored and determined to meet criteria for Urgent Alerts, a physician investigator at the Sleep Reading Center reviews the study. If an urgent alert is verified, it is logged into an Urgent Alert Log, and the ppt receives the full report and quality within a week after final scoring is complete.  Urgent Alert criteria include:

* Baseline oxygen saturation (prior to sleep onset) of <88%
* Heart rate for more than 2 continuous minutes that is <30 or >150 BPM
* The presence of a sustained wide complex rhythm (>3 consecutive beats) awake or asleep
* Type 2 second degree and third degree atrioventricular block
* New atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter
* Known a-fib and/or flutter at >120 or <50 BPM
* Ventricular fibrillation or persistent ventricular tachycardia for >2 minutes
* Other symptomatic arrhythmia

For studies that are not clearly urgent (i.e. studies that do not explicitly meet Urgent Alert criteria, but necessitate further review), scorers should notify Dr. Redline of the study via email and ask what further steps should be taken.
