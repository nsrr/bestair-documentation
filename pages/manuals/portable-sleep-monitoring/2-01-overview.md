## 2.1 Overview

At the Screening Visit, after written informed consent is obtained, subjects will be instructed in the use of the Embletta (Embla) portable monitor.  This battery-operated device can store data at 200 Hz, with 125 MB of storage capacity allowing storage of data from up to 1-24 hours of recording.  The device contains the critical sensors recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) as validated sensors for measuring OSA: nasal pressure/flow; thoracic and abdominal inductance plethysmography (effort); and finger pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation) (_NONIN OEM board_).  In addition, signals for body position and a 3-lead ECG are available.
