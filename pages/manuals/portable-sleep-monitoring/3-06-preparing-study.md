## 3.6 Subject Instruction

Subjects will be taught how to self-apply the sensors in their own homes.  Dr. Redline has evaluated this approach using a device similar to the one proposed for use in this study; among 157 patients who were instructed in the clinic and then self-applied sensors in their homes, overall study failure rate was <6% for acquisition of a minimum of 4 hours of artifact-free data.  Application of sensors will be demonstrated by trained certified staff.  Subjects will be asked to demonstrate their understanding of sensor placement and will be provided with simple pictorial and written instructions.  Subjects will be asked to apply the sensors before bedtime and remove them upon awakening.  When units are returned to the clinic site (by FedEx) the data will be downloaded to local computers, reviewed by the BWH site team to ensure data adequacy, and graded for quality.  Studies will be scored within 2 business days of receipt, using approaches described previously and following AASM guidelines for standard hypopnea and apnea definitions. Studies that do not meet minimal quality grades (4 hours of scoreable record) will be repeated.
