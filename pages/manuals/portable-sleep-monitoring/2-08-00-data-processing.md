## 2.8 Data Processing

Overnight PSG was recorded using an Embletta Type III sleep monitor.  After download into Emblaâ€™s RemLogic software studies were graded to determine pass/fail based on signal availability and reliability.  Recordings were then exported as EDF and imported into Compumedics Profusion 3 for scoring.  Automatic analysis was run on SpO2 followed by manual scoring of respiratory events.  Text and SAS reports were generated in Profusion with resulting sleep statistics and QA data entered into an Embletta QS form in REDCap.
