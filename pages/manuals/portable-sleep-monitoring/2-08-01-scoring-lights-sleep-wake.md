## 2.8.1 Scoring Lights and Sleep/Wake Periods

**<u>Lights OFF</u>** is based on the participant’s self-reported time to bed.  When this information is absent or occurs after clear sleep onset Lights OFF is set at Sleep Onset.

**<u>Lights ON</u>** is based on the participant’s self-reported wake time.  If this is not available or reliable, Lights ON is marked after the last epoch scored as sleep (i.e. sleep offset) until the last epoch of the recording.

**<u>Sleep Onset</u>** is based on both a self-reported “Sleep Time” and a qualitative assessment which includes evidence of reduction in artifact across channels, reduction in heart rate, and assumption of rhythmic breathing.

**<u>Sleep Offset</u>** is based on both a self-reported “Wake Time” and the appearance of sustained movement artifact, increased heart rate and signal loss caused by removal of the ambulatory monitor.

**<u>Sleep Periods</u>** are scored from sleep onset to sleep offset so long as there is evidence of sustained reduction in artifact across channels, sustained reduction in heart rate, and sustained assumption of rhythmic breathing. Since EEG is not recorded, sleep periods will be scored as stage 2 sleep only.  However, wake periods may take place during the sleep period and would therefore need to be scored.

**<u>Wake Periods</u>** that occur during the estimated sleep period can be marked if there are consecutive epochs with consistent activity and/or artifact.   Wake periods are scored when the oximetry signal or all respiratory signals have dropped out or are unreliable due to movement or signal artifact. Generally, these periods are at least 10-15 minutes long, but there is no minimum duration requirement.  If the recording continues to be unscorable for the rest of the recording, Lights ON and sleep offset should be marked at the point that the recording becomes unscorable. The QS form should reflect lost data when the signal quality and overall study quality is evaluated, and should contain notes that discuss this.
