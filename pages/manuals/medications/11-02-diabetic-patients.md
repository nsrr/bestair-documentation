## 11.2 Diabetic Patient Considerations

Study staff needs to be extra vigilant with participants who are diabetic.

Although we ask all participants per the protocol to be fasting before the baseline, 6 month and final visits, exceptions for diabetic participants are necessary for safety reasons.

Please communicate with the participant before the visit, that if they are feeling woozy or nauseous from fasting and holding medications, they should eat a small snack and drink as needed before they arrive.

Also, ask the participant to notify staff if they need to eat a snack or drink during the visit testing. Safety of our participants is of utmost importance and we want to be particularly cautious with diabetics when we know fasting can cause problems. If the participant needs to have a snack or drink, staff can document and let the data coordinating center know for data tracking purposes.
