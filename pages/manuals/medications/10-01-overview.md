## 10.1 Overview

Prior to all study visits, inform participants to continue taking all medicines they are currently on (especially blood pressure medicines) EXCEPT instruct them to withhold diabetes medicines. Diabetes medicines should be held until after the fasting blood draw, but should be brought along to the visit and taken as soon as the blood draw is completed.

Safety is always first, so if a participant feels they need to take their diabetes medication sooner, then this should be allowed but documented. Submit a deviation form to the SDCC so data can be flagged when doing analyses.

Participants may arrive for visits who have withheld high blood pressure medication in error. Check with each participant on arrival. If not taken, have these participants take their blood pressure medicine before starting any procedures. Wait at least an hour before taking resting BP.

To avoid unnecessary deviations and uphold safety and data integrity, it is extremely important for study staff to try their best to inform participants about taking all medicines except diabetes medicines. Emphasize these instructions when scheduling participant visits, include in visit reminder letters and during any visit reminder calls. Always ask participants to bring all the medicines they are currently taking to visits so to accurately document on the Medications form.

Below is a list of diabetes medicines participants should withhold. (Always consult with your PI or medical monitor if you have any questions concerning individual participant circumstances.)
