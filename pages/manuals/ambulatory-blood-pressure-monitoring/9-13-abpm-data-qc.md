## 9.13 ABPM Data Quality Control

Consistency of editing of the AMBP records will be addressed by assigning a single trained scorer who is blinded to treatment arm and has the task of editing all AMBP records. Artifacts will be edited and each record will be coded for duration of recording and number of valid and artifact readings (BP Quality Form).

The edited ABP file will be electronically transmitted. Records with values that exceed Urgent Referral levels will be identified, with notification of the site PI. The edited report will provide the following summary BP measurements:

1. Average systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial BP during wakefulness and sleep;
2. Nocturnal BP dipping (Systolic, diastolic, and mean BP dipping during sleep derived by calculating the difference between awake and sleep BP, expressed as a percentage of BP during wakefulness)
3. BP variability during sleep (average SD of sleep systolic, diastolic, and mean BPs).
