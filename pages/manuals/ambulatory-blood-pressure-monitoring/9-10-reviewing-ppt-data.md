## 9.10 Reviewing the Participant Report

* 1. Advance through the pages of the final report to the ABP Raw Data Tabular by selecting **Next** 4 times.
* 2. Look at the participant’s 24 Hour Blood Pressure Journal.

 * If information is incomplete on the journal, contact the participant to ascertain bed/wake times during monitor use.
 * If unable to ascertain, use data from the “usual” bed/wake times from page 1 of the Baseline Health Questionnaire.

* 3. Select **Setting** at the top of the screen to open the Report Settings Statistics tab.
* 4. Change the Start Hour for wake and sleep based on the reported sleep times reported in the participant journal. **This is a very important step that affects summary report information.**
* 5. Double check the Auto Edit Limits are set appropriately.
* 6. Select **OK**.
* 7. Select the cell in the **Diary Activity** column that matches the approximate time on the journal (or health questionnaire).
* 8. Select from the drop down menu from the list or type in what is on the journal (e.g. napping).

Daytime napping should be noted separately from sleeping. **<u>It is VERY IMPORTANT to list the time the participant was sleeping here.</u>**  It is necessary in final analyses.

* 9. Select **Close** at the top of the screen.
* 10. Select **Yes** to save changes.
