## 9.8 Placement of ABPM Cuff

1. The patient should be standing for research staff to measure and place the cuff.
2. Ask the patient whether he/she is a righty or a lefty.  If a righty, ask him/her to outstretch his/her left arm with palm facing up. If lefty, the right arm.  Ask the patient if he/she has any problems with taking the blood pressure on that arm. (If a patient has had a mastectomy, surgery, or injury on that side, it is preferable to use the other side.) Measure circumference of participant’s upper arm at the midpoint of the arm for cuff size determination. The monitor should go on the side of the body that is opposite to the arm where the cuff is placed.
3. Feel for the brachial artery on the arm and put a dot with a washable marker so that the arrow on the cuff points towards that dot.
4. Make sure that the midpoint of the cuff is at the level of the heart to avoid reading errors due to hydrostatic pressure differences. This way, the bottom of the cuff is also not at the elbow, but a little higher up as the cuff tends to slide downwards. The cuff slips and moves very easily.
5. No more than one finger should be able to fit comfortably under the cuff.
6. Once the cuff is applied, the arm should be relaxed at the patient’s side.
7. Have the patient sit down as you go over the instructions.
8. Show the patient how to enter information in the 24 Hour Blood Pressure Journal.
9. Make sure the patient knows what to do if the cuff becomes very uncomfortable during a measurement, if it slips out of place, or if event codes are displayed on the monitor screen. Also, ensure that the patient knows how to care for the monitor.
10. When the cuff gets tight, **STAY STILL**, **KEEP YOUR ARM STILL**, and **HOLD IT STILL** until the cuff is loose again.
11. “If you feel the cuff squeezing your arm, do not remove and TRY TO STOP MOVING – just stand still. If the cuff inflation becomes painful, remove the cuff and press the blue button on the top of the monitor. Put the monitor back on you once the cuff deflates. Press the blue button again once the cuff is on your arm properly. If pressing the blue button does not deflate the cuff, remove the cuff, flip the black switch near the bottom of the monitor, and leave the cuff alone until it deflates. Put the cuff back on, flip the black switch, and press the blue button to inflate the cuff again.”
12. **“We want awake and sleep blood pressures, so it is important to try as hard as possible to wear the monitor and not take it off for 24 hours. Do not take it into the shower with you. If you take it off before going into the shower, please remember to put it back on when you are finished and <u>DRY</u>.”**
13. Teach patient how to put cuff on for himself/herself in front of a mirror or with a spouse or significant other. Tell patient to please treat the equipment gently. No hard knocks, bumps, or drops. No contact sports or swimming.
14. Show the participant the patient instructions to take home.
15. <u>Arrangements must be made for return of the equipment and completed diary prior to leaving the facility.</u>  A prepaid shipping container may be provided for this purpose if other arrangements (courier service) have not been made.
