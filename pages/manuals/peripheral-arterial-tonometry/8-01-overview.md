## 8.1 Overview

Measurements will be performed using the SphygmoCor (Atcor Medical, AU) device with use of a probe containing a high fidelity piezoresistive Millar pressure transducer over the radial artery with a minimum of two consecutive measurements to obtain pulse wave analysis results. Orientation and pressure applied to the transducer will be adjusted to optimize applanation of the artery between the transducer and the underlying tissue. Pulse wave velocity will be obtained by assessing time delay using lead II ECG (LL, LA, RA) recording as well as carotid and femoral applanation tonometry. Pulse wave analysis will provide a measure of central aortic pressure which has been found to be a better predictor of cardiovascular and renal disease than peripheral/brachial blood pressure. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity is considered the Gold Standard for the measurement of aortic stiffness, an indirect measure of atherosclerosis.
