## 9.6.2 Parasternal Short Axis View

**In the ideal echocardiographic “window” for the short axis:**

* Record at the following levels:

 * At mitral valve when both anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets are visualized.
 * At the mid-papillary muscle level with the papillary muscles visible.

* Use internal LV landmarks – this is extremely important.
* All study echos should be obtained at the same levels to allow for a correct comparison.
* For the quantification of left ventricular mass, M-mode recordings of the left ventricle should be obtained with the ultrasound beam at or just below the tips of the mitral valve leaflets in the parastemal short-axis view, for the required number of cardiac cycles.  Minimal valvular apparatus should be visible in the image.
* To enable calculation of the pulmonary vascular resistence (PVR), the right ventricular outflow tract time-velocity integral (TVIRVOT) (cm) should be obtained by placing a 1- to 2-mm pulsed wave Doppler sample volume in the proximal right ventricular outflow tract just within the pulmonary valve when imaged from the parasternal short-axis view. The sample volume should be placed so that the closing but not opening click of the pulmonary valve is visualized. **Pulsed wave Doppler** should be used rather than continuous wave Doppler to eliminate cases with increased pulmonary velocities secondary to either pulmonary valve or peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis.
* Continuous wave Doppler was used to determine the peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) (m/s). The highest velocity obtained from multiple views should be obtained.
