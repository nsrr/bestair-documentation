## 9.6.4 Apical 5-Chamber View

**In the ideal echocardiographic “window” for the Apical 5-Chamber View:**

* Be careful to maximize LV length and not truncate the true long axis.
* Standard 2D imaging of the apical five-chamber view should be obtained with images adjusted to optimize endocardial resolution.
* In this view, record LV outflow tract Pulse Wave Doppler. The Doppler sample volume should be positioned 5 mm proximal to the aortic valve.
* Recordings should be performed at 100 mm/s over five cardiac cycles.
* Record the isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), defined as the interval from the closure of the aortic valve to the opening of the mitral valve.
* With PW Doppler, the transducer is angulated into the apical five-chamber and the sample volume placed within the LVOT, but in proximity to the anterior mitral valve leaflet to record both inflow and outflow. **Three to five cardiac cycles should be recorded.**
* For the purpose of deriving the TEI index, the mitral inflow doppler velocity curves (along with the LV outflow velocity doppler as described above) must be recorded along with simultaneous ECG traces.
