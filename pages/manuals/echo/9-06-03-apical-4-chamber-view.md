## 9.6.3 Apical 4-Chamber View

**In the ideal echocardiographic “window” for the Apical 4-Chamber View:**

* Be careful to maximize LV length and not truncate the true long axis.
* The entire LV endocardium must be within the sector scan in both end-diastole and end-systole. Pay special attention the apex and the lateral LV free wall; the most difficult areas to visualize.
* Be sure to properly align the image and capture the left atrium in full. Avoid any foreshortening of the chamber.

### 9.6.3.1 Color and Spectral Doppler of Mitral Inflow

In addition to 2D imaging, the following Doppler examinations will be required from this view.

**IMAGE**

* From the apical four chamber view: record the mitral inflow velocity curve with the pulsed-wave Doppler sample volume positioned at the tips of the mitral leaflets during quiet respiration for 30 seconds (or at least five cardiac cycles).
* For all Doppler recordings:

 * Standardize sample volume size (5 mm is recommended).
 * Take care to align the Pulsed Doppler signal parallel to the presumed direction of flow.
 * Set the scale to 80 cm/sec and record at 50 mm/sec and 100 mm/sec sweep speeds for at least five cardiac cycles - the faster speed is essential for more accurate measurements.
 * Reset scale if necessary to optimize the flow signal.

### 9.6.3.2 Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) Spectra of Mitral Annulus

**IMAGE**

1. From the lateral aspect of the mitral annulus, decrease image depth (to include the LV and a small part of the LA) and optimize the 2D image for the LV, focusing on the lateral wall and mitral annular region.
2. Adjust the image to orient the motion of the lateral wall parallel to the cursor. Both gains and filter settings should be set low to obtain the best images.
3. Initiate 2D color DTI and position the sample volume on the ventricular side of the lateral mitral annulus: the myocardium should stay within the sample volume for as much of the cardiac cycle as possible.
4. The sample volume should be placed at the junction of the LV wall with the mitral annulus of the septal and lateral myocardial segments from the four-chamber view and inferior and anterior myocardial segments from the two-chamber view (thus the sample volume is best set at the center of the region of the myocardium to be studied).
5. Before the data is acquired, check that only the region to be sampled is moving through the sample volume.
6. Switch to PW spectral DTI and set the scale to 20 cm/sec with a sweep speed of 100 mm/sec.
7. Before collecting data, set the Pulsed Doppler velocity range to avoid velocity aliasing (a velocity range of +/- 24 cm/sec is normal though patients with high heart rates may require a higher setting).
8. Once a clear pattern is obtained, record at least 10-20 beats during quiet respiration (or preferably during breath holding at end-expiration).

### 9.6.3.3 Color M-Mode Doppler (CMM)

Color M-Mode (CMM) is used to derive the propagation velocity of early flow into the LV cavity (Vp) and is useful as a complimentary index of LV filling.  The CMM of the LV inflow represents velocity and measures the rate of propagation of LV peak filling velocity during diastole.

##### 9.6.3.3.1 Obtaining a High Quality CMM Exam of LV Filling

1. Start with an apical 4-chamber view using a standard 2-D depth of 16 cm.
2. Adjust the color sector to fit only over the LV chamber including the mitral valve and a portion of the LA to maximize the color frame rate and provide a better quality CMM.
3. Adjust the velocity scale for color aliasing by moving the baseline of the Color Doppler scale up (in the 40 range). Remember to return the baseline to the original setting once the CMM has been completed.
4. With the goal to obtain the longest column of color from the base of the mitral annulus to the apex, place the M-mode cursor through the center of flow, aligning the cursor as parallel to the direction of the LV inflow as possible.
5. The LV fills from the base and propagates laterally towards the apex.  The imaging transducer may be displaced towards the lateral wall if needed to position the M-mode scan line in parallel with the direction of flow observed by two-dimensional color Doppler.  Avoid crossing the myocardial boundary regions.
6. Adjust the color gain setting just below saturation and record the M-mode sweep speed at 100 mm/sec.
7. Recordings should be acquired at end-expiration to minimize misalignment due to translation.
8. Several measurements should be averaged, especially if the patient has an irregular heart rhythm.

**In obtaining a CMM, pay special attention to correct placement of the M-mode cursor. In addition, careful attention should be made to avoid measuring intracavitary flow originating before the onset of mitral inflow.**
