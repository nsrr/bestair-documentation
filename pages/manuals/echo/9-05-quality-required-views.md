## 9.5 Echocardiographic Quality and Required Views to Obtain

### 9.5.1 Importance of High Quality Echos

Quantitative measurements of LV function entail manually digitizing the left ventricular endocardium at end-diastole and end-systole. Even when images are of good quality, this can be extremely difficult, and it is therefore critically important that the best possible endocardial definition is obtained.

### 9.5.2 Endocardial Border Definition

* Sonographers should optimize endocardial border definition at their own discretion.
* Machine-specific optimizations that enhance endocardial border definition should be used. These include, but are not limited to, tissue harmonic imaging, power motion imaging, etc. **Please avoid utilizing automatic border detection systems as these are not accurate and will obscure the image.**

### 9.5.3 Instructions

* Echos should be performed in the order of the required views listed in Table 1.
* Recording should start when the view is optimized and end after the required number of cardiac cycles have been recorded per view (at least 3 for digital media and at least 10 for videotape).

### 9.5.4 Table 1: Required Views to Obtain

**NOTE:**   To be acceptable for the study, the parasternal long and short axis views, and the apical views, must be of sufficient quality to allow for digitization of the LV endocardium.
