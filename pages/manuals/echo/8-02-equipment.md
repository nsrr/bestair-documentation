## 8.2 Equipment

* A 3.5 MHz transducer is recommended for obtaining images though some patients might require a lower or higher frequency to obtain optimal results (acceptable range: 2.5 to 5 MHz). Please use the same frequency transducer for all the studies on a given patient.
* Please use the highest possible frequency that allows adequate penetration for endocardial border definition.
* At least 3 cardiac cycles per view are required.  At least 6 cardiac cycles per view are required if the patient has any atrial or ventricular arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter.
* Please use tissue harmonic imaging, unless this worsens endocardial border definition.
