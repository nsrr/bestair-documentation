## 8.4 Patient Preparation

* The patient should be placed in the steep left lateral decubitus position unless this position is medically contraindicated for the patient.
* Electrocardiographic leads (3-lead) should be placed on the patient prior to imaging and an adequate ECG signal in which the QRS complex is clearly identifiable should be visible on the echocardiographic monitor.
* Echocardiograms should be obtained in a manner that is most consistent with good-quality patient care. Patient care issues including patient comfort should always supercede research interests. Indeed, patient cooperation and comfort are extraordinarily important in obtaining the highest quality echocardiographic examination.
* If there are any characteristics of this patient that prohibit or make it difficult to perform the echo, please be sure to document this on the _Echo QC/Tracking Form_ in order that the reader is aware of any difficulties or obstacles in performing the echo.
