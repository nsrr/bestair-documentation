## 11.4 Adherence Monitoring

The ResMed devices measure adherence through the wireless ResTraxx system for BWH monitoring, and via the downloadable SD card for use by SHC.
The Philips active devices measure adherence using the wireless Encore system and the Philips sham devices measure adherence using the Smart Card with direct downloads to EncoreAnywhere accessible by SHC.  The downloaded compliance data from the Philips sham will be provided to BWH as a PDF from Don Ordway.
At each RT visit, the therapist will check compliance data and provide feedback to the participant.  Continuously, un-blinded research personnel will monitor compliance and notify appropriate staff for issues related to noncompliance, excessive leak, or any other problem deemed necessary. If problems are noted with poor use or excessive leak, the respiratory therapist will call the participant and determine a plan for further action (ex. discuss with Michael Morrical, refer to RT, arrange a mask switch).
