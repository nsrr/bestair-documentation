## 11.3 Sham CPAP

A sham ResMed (S9 Escape) with heated humidifier or sham Respironics with cool air humidifier will be provided (chosen by randomization scheme). The CPAP prescription Case Report Form in the subjectâ€™s binder will have serial numbers indicating the flow generator, humidifier and wireless device. Only ResMed sham will have a wireless device. Devices will be prepared and available for each participant at the time of his/her RT set-up visit.

### 11.3.1 Philips Sham Machines (REMstar Pro 2)

The sham units differ from the active PAP units: these devices contain the resistors that influence the delivered pressure.

Low pressure (<2cm) is achieved by using an elbow with a large expiratory port that interfaces with the masks. The motor is set to deliver 10 cm H2O and the restrictor limits flow output to approximately 50L/m through the restrictor. The display should reveal a set pressure of 10 cmH2O. The unit is designed to deliver a circuit pressure of ~ 0.75 cm H2O and peak pressure of ~ 2.5 cm H2O.

**Figure 1.** The lower delivered pressure is created by using a modified elbow with the unit. Standard nasal masks can be used (no pillows or full face masks) with special elbows

### 11.3.2 ResMed Sham Machines (S9 Escapes)

These S9 Escape units are set to deliver <1 cm H2O pressure through use of resistors built into special swivels and elbows and masks with expiratory ports.
To use the device on sham setting, the max ramp and EPR are set to OFF, mode to CPAP, and the Mask to either Nasal or Pillow. Climate Ctrl: Auto. The pressure should be set to 4 cmH2O.
Only three types of sham masks can be used with the S9 Escapes (these masks are specially modified):   Mirage Activa LT, Mirage FX Nasal Mask or Swift FX Nasal Pillow Mask. Each mask requires a specific elbow/swivel. Each device also requires use of a ClimateControl tubing.
