## 12.2 Active CPAP

A study ResMed S9 AutoPAP or Respironics machine (Philips System One) with heated humidifiers will be provided (chosen by randomization scheme). Serial numbers will be recorded on the Prescription CRF page.  Ramp and EPR will be set.

**<u>If a participant had split or full-night sleep study prior to randomization</u>**, the study machine will not be set for auto delivery of pressure but set at the previously determined optimal fixed pressure from prior split or full night titration study or from an APAP trial (for those whose insurance do not allow in-lab titration). Note that these machines will be replaced by clinically-ordered machines at the termination of each patient’s participation in the study.

**<u>For patient’s requiring in-home titration</u>**, an APAP device will have its pressure set to start automatically, ranging from 4 to a maximum of 20 cwp. The recording will be considered to be acceptable if both conditions are met:

* The recording period in the auto titration device averaged at least 4 hours/night  for at least 2 nights
* Excessive leak was absent.  The optimal PAP pressure will be identified as the 90th % percentile pressure setting in segments without an unacceptable leak.
