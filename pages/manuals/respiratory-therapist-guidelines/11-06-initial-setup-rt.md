## 11.6 Initial Setup Visits with Respiratory Therapist

Note that patients will be randomized to receive study equipment which will be either a Philips Respironics or ResMed S9 device used in the CPAP mode. For sham, each device is set up with masks, machine/machine settings and elbow configurations as noted above.

* 1. Educate subject on use of equipment per the SAM guide.
* 2. Fit and provide mask according to unit assigned and any restrictions based on sham assignments; check subject’s placement of mask and need for chin strap
* 3. Discuss possible side effects if mask is not placed properly
* 4. Allow an acclimation period after mask fit: provide opportunity to use device for at least 15 minutes, supine, adjusting the mask fit as needed
* 5. Provide subject with PAP Therapy Manual (specifically for sham – Manual will have red dot, same as on subject’s chart) and other information usually included in starter kit

**Note:** Please enter the mask style and size given to the subject on the Prescription Case Report Form. Record any comments/notes on Progress Notes sheet provided in subject’s binder

* 6. Remind subject about subsequent RT appointments.
* 7. Remind patients not to change machine settings and to report to study coordinator any problems with comfort, breathing during the night, sinus or nasal congestion or worsening of sleepiness
