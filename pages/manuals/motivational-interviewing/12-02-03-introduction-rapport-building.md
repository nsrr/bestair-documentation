    <strong>TYPICAL DAY: KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER</strong>
    Ask the person to tell their story, with as little interruption as possible. Use open ended questions to keep them talking (e.g., what happened then? How did you feel? Can you tell me more?). Use reflections to clarify your understanding and let the participant know you are listening. Don’t try to solve problem; just gather information and build rapport

_“How was your experience with CPAP in the lab?”_

* Probe for both benefits and challenges.
