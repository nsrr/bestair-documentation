## 12.2.5 Information Exchange: Pre-treatment Sleep Study

_”Would you like to know more about how a difficult night like this can affect someone’s life?”_

Review causes and symptoms of sleep apnea and the medical consequences of sleep apnea for the general population.

* Discuss what happens to people “in general” rather than personalizing the results. Present information in a neutral and non-threatening manner.
* **_“What, if any, of these are relevant for you?”_** Have the patient identify consequences that are particularly important to him/her.

    <strong><u>TIP SHEET:</u></strong>

        **Medical Consequences of Sleep Apnea** - The tip sheet works best if the person looks at the sheet him or herself, and is asked whether or not anything stands out, or is surprising.  Explore each bullet that the person picks out (how it affects their life and activities).

**Ask permission for information exchange.** _“I have the initial results from the sleep study that you took a few weeks ago. You may have spoken with your doctor about some aspects of the results, but I can go over them in more detail with you and discuss how your results compare with those of other people,” Would you like to discuss these results?”_
