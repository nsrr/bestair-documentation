## 13.3.6 Information Exchange: CPAP Benefits for Health & Functioning

_“Last time you were here we discussed how your level of apnea, if untreated, makes you susceptible to medical problems. Today I’d like to talk with you a bit about how sleep apnea affects memory, concentration, and alertness. Is that okay with you?”_

    <strong><u>Tips Sheets</u></strong>
    * **Medical Benefits of SA Treatment**
    * **How CPAP can improve your daily functioning**
    * **Feedback Form showing cognitive improvements by amount of CPAP**
  </p>

_“The good news is that there is something you can do about the effects that sleep apnea has on your daily functioning.”  Have person look at tip sheets and pick out what’s relevant for them. Discuss each bullet that they pick. How does it affect their daily life, for example?_

* Discuss medical-related benefits specific to patient that were identified in the first session.
* Review aspects of daily functioning that are improved by CPAP.
* Show change in vigilance and sleepiness by amount of use of CPAP

_“Another piece of good news is that if you use CPAP long enough, you’re very likely to make improvements in several areas of functioning. For example, as you can see by the chart, individuals using CPAP at least 4 hours a night show dramatic improvement in their ability to focus their attention, compared to those using less than that. Even more, those using 5 or more hours a night show a dramatic reduction in daytime sleepiness. What does this information personally mean to you?”_

* Empathize with the patient’s concerns over daily functional impairment and reinforce any insight that using CPAP is important.

_“How do you feel about these findings?”_
