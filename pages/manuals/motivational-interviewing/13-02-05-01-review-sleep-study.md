_“The sleep study measured the number of times you stopped breathing for at least ten seconds every hour while you slept. This is called the Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) or the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI).”_

RDI 5-15 = Mild; >15-30 = Moderate; >30 = Severe

_“It might be hard to understand what not breathing for 10 seconds feels like, so I would like to do an exercise with you, if that’s ok (wait for affirmation). I would like you to hold your breath while I count out ten seconds in my head. We can start whenever you are ready. (Have them hold breath and count ten good seconds). How did you feel?_

_On this table you can see that your RDI is ____. This means that you stopped breathing about ____ times per hour of sleep. This falls in the ____________ (mild, moderate, severe) range compared to someone without sleep apnea. How do you feel about this? (COMPARE TO NORMAL PERSON)_

_The sleep study also measured the level of oxygen in your blood during sleep. People without sleep apnea generally have about >90 % of their blood oxygenated during sleep. We have results of your level of oxygen intake during sleep and how this compares to the oxygen intake of someone without sleep apnea. As you can see, your level of oxygen intake is_____________._

_People who score in the moderate to severe range on these measures generally have greater risk of high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease. This is because having lower levels of oxygen puts an added strain on all of the organs in your body, especially your heart.”_

**Probe further by asking 1 or 2 of the following:**

* _“What are your thoughts about these results?”_
* _“How do you think this might affect you?”_
* _“How do you feel about these findings?”_

    <strong><u>KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER</u></strong>
    * Empathize and use reflections; “I know this may be difficult to hear.”
    * Adopt a curious and eliciting interview style, rather than a preachy, educational style.
    * **<u>Personalize results.</u>** Determine if patient is having any early signs or symptoms of disease that is related to sleep apnea.
    * **<u>Focus on the patient’s concerns and reactions</u>**, rather than your own interpretation.
