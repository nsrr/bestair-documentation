## 12.3.3 Introduction and Checking In

_“Hi ____________ (client’s name). Nice to see you again. Summarize last session: (Example: “The last time we met you indicated that you wanted to treat your sleep apnea because you want to have more energy to play with your kids and you were tired of being so tired. You were quite surprised about how sleep apnea affected your body, specifically the amount of oxygen in your blood, but you thought this made sense because you are tired all of the time. You were also relieved to see that the CPAP increased the levels of Oxygen in your blood and that you are in less respiratory distress when you sleep using the CPAP machine. What thoughts have you had since our last session?”_

_“Many people have difficulty initially getting used to using CPAP at home. What’s it been like for you?”_

If they don’t talk about how much they’ve used it: _“Tell me how much you have been able to use the CPAP machine this week.”_

* Reinforce any use by stating that, at first, it is typical to use less than every night.
* Empathize: a lot of people have trouble using it consistently in the first couple of months.

_“What aspects of using CPAP are difficult?”_

* Empathize with difficulties encountered with CPAP use.

_“What, if any, benefits have you noticed?”_

* Reinforce positive aspects. If there are none, say “Some people notice that the benefits of CPAP come after a few months of consistent nightly use.”

_“Where would you like to see yourself in three months in terms of using CPAP?”_

_“What do you think your life will be like by (New Years, ---some event 6 months from now) if you continue to use CPAP?”_

_“What do you think your life will be like by (same date) if you decide to not use CPAP (or use it infrequently)?”_


**<u>Information Exchange: Video of Interview with a Patient</u>**

**Ask permission for information exchange.** _“I have a video of an actual patient talking about her experiences with sleep apnea. It illustrates how she gets accustomed to using PAP therapy. I’d like to show it to you, if that’s all right with you.”_

_“How do you feel after watching this video?”_

_“How might this relate to you/tell me your thoughts about the video?”_
