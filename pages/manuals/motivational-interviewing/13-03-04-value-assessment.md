## 13.3.4 Values Assessment

_“I would like to find out a little more about what’s most important to you, or how you like to spend your time.”_

Counselor, focus on:

* Tangible goals: (e.g., a nice apartment/home, car)
* Activity goals: (e.g., go on a trip, be more active, play sports like golf, play with kids or grandkids)
* Health goals (lose weight, have more energy, live longer)
* How they like to spend their free time (If you could spend a day doing something that you enjoy doing, what would that be?)

    Try to have the participant list three things from the above items. Explore each one briefly. Why was that item chosen? Why is it important to the person? Get the person to explore the positive things about the option they chose, and why they look forward to it. Then chose one of the three to build a discrepancy, using the following questions.

_“What are the chances, on a scale of 0-100, that you will be able to achieve your goal of____________ if you use CPAP for XX hours (specific to individual from session 1 goals-- example, 2 or more hours night?_

* Summarize the values and priorities that the client has expressed. e.g., “Thank you for sharing this information… I now have a clearer picture of what’s most important to you right now.”
* Reflect back the priorities that the participant describes, and highlight discrepancies between current sleep apnea and broader values/goals.
