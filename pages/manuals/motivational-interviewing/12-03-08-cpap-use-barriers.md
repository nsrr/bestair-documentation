## 12.3.8 Explore Barriers to CPAP Use (Experienced or Anticipated)

Based on the client’s level of motivation, explore the barriers that might get in the way of him/her using CPAP more successfully. Refer back to the decisional balance tip sheet completed at the beginning of session 2.

_“Last time we met you mentioned that _____________ (list difficulties listed on the decisional balance tip sheet) makes it hard for you to use (or want to use) CPAP on a regular basis. How much do these things still make it difficult for you to use the CPAP regularly?”_

_“What might make it easier for you to use CPAP?”_

**If participant cannot identify any barriers, reflect back their level of confidence and remind them of some challenges they have raised.** Ex. “You seem to be pretty confident that you will be able to use CPAP without any difficulties. However, earlier you mentioned that you are still having difficulties with consistently using the machine, especially when you travel. What are your thoughts about this?”

If participant doesn’t express difficulties, acknowledge his commitment to CPAP use.

* **Emphasize the benefits** he believes he will get from routine CPAP use, and **the consequences** that he would expect if he didn’t use CPAP.
* Encourage participant to use own creative problem-solving and identify steps or thoughts (ex. reminding myself that CPAP is important for my overall well-being) that support routine use of CPAP
