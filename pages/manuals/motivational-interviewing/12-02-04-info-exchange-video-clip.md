## 12.2.4 Information Exchange: Video Clip of OSA Patient

_“I’d like to know how much you have been told about sleep apnea in general. What is your understanding of the condition? Would you like to know what I know about OSA?”_

**If yes:** _"Sleep apnea occurs when you stop breathing many times throughout the night. In most cases it is a result of a blockage of your throat that keeps air from coming in and going out. This makes you stop breathing."_

**Ask permission for information exchange.** _“I have a video clip of an individual during his overnight sleep study. It illustrates what actually happens during an episode of sleep apnea. I’d like to show it to you, if that’s all right with you.”_

**<u>Explanation during the Video</u>**

_“The patient is fitted with two straps across his chest to monitor how much his chest moves in an effort to breathe. He also has a small tube on the outside of his nose that detects whether or not air is flowing in and out. As you can see here, his chest continues to move, but now he is not breathing. His chest movements will become more obvious and even pretty strong in an attempt to breathe. You can see that his body is really trying to breathe. Soon he will gasp for air and catch his breath without fully waking up.” WAIT FOR THIS. “That is what one apnea episode looks like. Now he will go right into another apnea episode.” LET THEM WATCH._

_“How do you feel after watching this video?”_

_“How might this relate to you/tell me your thoughts about the video when you watch this?”_

    <strong><u>KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER:</u></strong>
    Empathize and use reflections; “I know this may be difficult to see.” Utilize <u>elicit—provide—elicit</u> process: ask an open-ended question, share some information and follow up with another open-ended question to get the patient’s reaction. Adopt a curious and eliciting interview style. <u>Focus on the patient’s concerns and reactions</u>, rather than your own interpretation.
