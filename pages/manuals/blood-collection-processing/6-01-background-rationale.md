## 6.1 Background and Rationale

The purpose of the study is to evaluate alternative approaches for reducing heart disease risk in patients with sleep apnea.  Study outcomes include assays of inflammation, coagulation, dyslipidemia, glucose metabolism and heart function.

Blood samples will be collected in the CCI/GCRCs affiliated with the Harvard Catalyst by trained research nurses at the baseline and each follow-up visit. Blood will be initially processed in these units and designated for: 1) transport to the Harvard Catalyst Core Laboratory; 2) LabCorp; and 3) archival in the freezers in the Division of Sleep Medicine, 221 Longwood Ave.

The blood samples collected and processed by Catalyst technicians or other dedicated study personnel are the foundation for many of these tests.  The most important step (and potentially the most variable) in these tests is the collection and processing of the blood samples.   If the blood sample itself is not correctly drawn and processed, the laboratory results may not be precise or may not be valid.

This study involves the collection of 40 ml of blood from participants during a fasting morning venipuncture (after a 12 hour overnight fast) and a spot urine collection, during the research exam visit.
