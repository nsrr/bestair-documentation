## 6.6.7 Special Circumstances

**<u>Plasma specimens cannot be processed within 30 minutes of collection.</u>**  If centrifugation cannot be performed within 30 minutes of collection, try to process specimens as soon as possible after that time. Maintain the plasma draw tubes on wet ice until centrifugation.

**<u>Serum and plasma cannot be frozen within 10 minutes of aliquoting.</u>** Every effort should be made to freeze serum and plasma cryovials and the tubes of packed cells at -70ºC or below as soon as possible after aliquoting.  All samples should be frozen in an upright position.  If specimens cannot be placed immediately at -70ºC or below, they may be temporarily (<2 hours) stored at -20ºC or placed on dry ice until transfer to -70ºC or below.  Dry ice is the preferred solution.
